1. Topic Modeller

This project starts off by instantiating a GUI object in the control class.

The user is then prompted to click a button to where they are greeted with a JFileChooer.

The user then selects as much files as they want, as long as its not less than 2.

These files are stored in an array after the user has selected them, this array is the
accessed in the Results class.

A Results object is then instantiated.

The first menu disappears and the user is greeted with a bigger JFrame containing a button\
and a JTextArea.

When the user presses the button. Number and letters are printed to the JTextArea.

Before they are printed, there are a few calcualtions that need to happen.

The Frequency of the words are counted and then the words ArrayList is compared to the
stopWords array in the StopWords class. These stop words are then removed
